## Fake Architecture Orchestrator
This project was developed as part of the coursework for the Cybersecurity module of the Master's degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Bologna.


## Abstract
The strategic use of deceptive defense has been proposed by cybersecurity experts as a method to exploit the typically enjoyed informational asymmetry of attackers, turning it into a tool favoring defenders. This strategy involves creating fake services and components that appear similar to valuable targets for aggressors, aiming to divert attackersâ€™ attention and resources away from critical assets. This project aims to easily instantiate a complex fake infrastructure from an architectural diagram, providing a tangible opportunity to implement and evaluate the deceptive defense strategy within the realm of cybersecurity.
